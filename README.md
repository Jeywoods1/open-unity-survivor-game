# Open Unity Survivor

Welcome to the Open Unity Survivor repository! 
This project is a showcase of my Unity game development skills, 
where I'm recreating the popular game "Vampire Survivors" from scratch. 
In this README, I'll provide you with an overview of the project and instructions on how to get started.

## Game Overview

"Vampire Survivors" is an engaging and challenging indie game where you
try to survive in a world filled with dangers. 
In this Unity remake, I've faithfully recreated the core gameplay mechanics 
and features of the original game, which include:

- [ ] **Character Selection:** Choose from multiple characters, each with different starting weapons and bonuses.
- [x] **Endless Stage:** Experience an auto-generated, repeating stage layout that offers a unique challenge with each playthrough.
- [x] **Automatic Weapon Attacks:** Your character's weapons attack automatically, allowing you to focus on survival.
- [x] **Monsters and Waves:** Face constant waves of monsters that deal damage upon contact (one monster for now, but it exists ðŸ˜Š). 
- [x] **Progression:** Collect experience gems to level up and gain access to new weapons and passive power-ups.
- [ ] **Items and Chests:** Find "floor chicken" to restore health and discover helpful items. Open chests dropped by powerful monsters to upgrade weapons and power-ups.
- [ ] **Ultimate Forms:** Most weapons have ultimate forms that can be unlocked through specific conditions.
- [ ] **Time-Limited Sessions:** Sessions have a soft time limit of 15 or 30 minutes, depending on the chosen stage. Surviving past the time limit spawns a final, powerful enemy named Death.
- [ ] **Unlockables:** Spend accumulated gold coins to unlock new characters, persistent power-ups, stages, weapons, and characters by completing challenges.
